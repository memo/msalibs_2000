# MSA Libs circa 1999/2000.

Mostly C++ interspersed with x86/x87 assembly. 

There seems to be code for handling:
- windows
- opengl
- directdraw
- basic maths
- 3D maths (vectors, matrices, quaternions)
- 2D / 3D complex numbers (FPU/ASM accelerated)
- perlin, gradient, fractal noise (FPU/ASM accelerated)
- basic 2D sprites and world management
- basic 3D scene management (nodes, cameras etc)
- keyboard & mouse input


I have no idea if this still works or is even compilable right now.

I definitely do *not* endorse this code and coding style (so many #defines! argh. It is from 15-16 years ago). Uploading it for archival purposes.
